\section{Introduction}
Intro...

Three rants:

1. Your algorithm should be implementable by someone else.

2. Your tool should always be compile-able and runnable. 

3. The benchmarks you are running on should be relevant. 


Your algorithm that I can't implement becuase your description lacks sufficient detail and reasoing about why something was done one way or another. 
Your tool that you talk of either doesn't exist for download. Or runs only one one particular platform. Or might run for you, right now, but will bot-rot in 2 months and, even you, cannot get it to compile again. 
Your benchmarks claim to be from the Windows device driver samples or something similar, but are stripped down versions of the originals. Stripped down so much as to be useless to anyone but you vs the referee. 

\section{Top Tips}
N.B. The ``rules'' should make reference to how this would improve the reusability of software that implemented the c.10 points...

Cite~\cite{collberg-et-al:2014}

\begin{itemize}
\item the code should have an appropriate open source license (recommendations?)
\item the code should be available on github or similar source control/repo?
\item you should provide the compiler and build toolchain
\item you should provide builds tools/makefiles/ant/etc and build instructions
\item you should list/link to all non-standard packages/libraries/APIs
\item main proposal: automatic online dependency/build/traffic light system with github hooks?
\item case studies: CS, systems biology?
\end{itemize}
